My partner is Svetlana Blinova
Trajectory:
Sinusoid trajectory. First, big arc goes to the right, then, same arc to the left. Finaly, two smaller arcs in the same order (right, left)

Sensor usage:
Gyroscope, wheel's encoders.
Data representation:
first column - time step (0,1 sec),
second column - gyro in amount of degree,
third and forth - encoders in amount of degrees (right and left wheel).

My work:
Using simple representation of trajectory with sensor data and using extended Kalman filter.
